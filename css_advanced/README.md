# CSS, advanced — SmileSchool (ALX)

This project builds the SmileSchool homepage from a Figma design using **only HTML & CSS** (no external libraries).  
Focus here is the HTML structure; styles come in later tasks.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Recreate the page structure from the Figma.
- Prepare clean, semantic markup ready for styling.
- No external libraries (no Bootstrap, no Font Awesome, no frameworks).

## ✨ Design
- Figma page: https://www.figma.com/design/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage?node-id=0-1
- Duplicate to your Drafts to inspect spacing, fonts, and assets.

Fonts noted in the brief:
- **Source Sans Pro**
- **Spin Cycle OT**

> Some measurements in Figma are floats — rounding is fine.
